This folder contains Monte Carlo simulations for stochastic pricing models, such as pricing bonds/options under Vasicek/CIR/G2++,
pricing fixed strike lookback option, pricing MBS, applying EFD/IFD/C-NFD method, pricing option on collateralized loan under jump-diffusion process. I used Python to build the models.
